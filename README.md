# Campus to Corporate

Corporate environments are the litmus tests for students' skills. In a competitive job market, this makes the "first job" difficult for students to earn, and for companies to place. It is *risky* for businesses to hire interns or entry-level employees with college qualifications -- and no relevant work experience. Too many students are unable to get work experience, *because* of a lack of work experience.

To solve this problem, we have devised a platform to connect students with employers for low-risk "trial" jobs. Organizations seeking interns or entry-level employees can use our site to publish short-term trials -- four- to sixteen-week projects -- and accept applications from students looking for work. Trials are kept short to reduce risky commitment while still offering valuable experience to students, and project deliverables to companies. To streamline the job-matching process, we offer student users a resume builder which templates data into a PDF; you may upload your own resume if you already have one. We take this data and match it against business-defined requirements -- "hard" skills and "soft" skills -- to list the most compatible trials first.
